Introduction to mv: matrix vision python wrapper
================================================

The mv package provides a python wrapper for image acquisition with hardware from `matrix vision <http://www.matrix-vision.de>`_.

This wrapper is written in cython and uses the C interface of the
mvIMPACT Acquire library. There used to exist a complete python
wrapper, provided by matrix vision, but support has been
dropped. Compared to this SWIG based wrapper, which closely followed
the C++ interface, the mv package offers a more pythonic interface,
see :doc:`tutorial`. This wrapper does *not* follow the original C++ interface.

Requirements
------------

* Python (tested with 2.6 and 2.7, should work with 2.5 - 3.4, 32 or 64bit)
* installed ``mvIMPACT Acquire`` library (gets installed together with device drivers)
* cython 15.1+ (git version) for installation from source (requires C
  compiler, e.g. Visual Studio 2008, or Windows Platform SDK 3.5)
* numpy (optional,  recommended for image manipulation)
* matplotlib (optional, for image display)
* IPython (optional)

Installation
------------

1. edit path to mvIMPACT Acquire library and include path in ``setup.py``

2. for complete build::
   python setup.py install

3. for in-place build (quick testing)::
   python setup.py build_ext -i

Building
~~~~~~~~

Some notes for building with the Windows platform SDK on XP:

1. Install the `Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework
3.5 SP1`.

2. add SDK bin to path (e.g. ``c:\Programme\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\bin``)

3. sdkenv.cmd::

     set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
     SetEnv /Release

4. create link with target ``C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /V:ON /K sdkenv.bat`
   
5. build module with::

      python setup.py build

   or inplace build (useful for testing/developing)::

      python setup.py build_ext -i
   
 
Building with Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler Package for Python 2.7

0. Install MS Compiler for Python 2.7
1. from Windows/Start Menu open "Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler Package for Python 2.7/Visual C++ 2008 32-bit Command Prompt"
2. after navigating to MVacquire folder in prompt:

    set MSSDK=1
    set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
    #python setup.py bdist_wininst
